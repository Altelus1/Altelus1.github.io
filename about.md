# About
<br />
Welcome, fellow hackerman! I am Altelus (a.k.a. FriedTempura). I do various
types of writeups from different CTFs (Capture The Flag) I joined. I mainly do reverse engineering and memory corruption type of writeups but I also do other categories. I also put here my projects I have completed.
<br /> 
Enjoy your stay, hackerman!
