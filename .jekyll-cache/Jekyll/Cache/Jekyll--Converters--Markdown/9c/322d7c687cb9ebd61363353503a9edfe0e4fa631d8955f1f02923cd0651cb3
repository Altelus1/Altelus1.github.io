Weâ€™re given a file:
<img src="images/kavm_1.png# big" alt="file missing" />
<br /></p>

<p>Checking it with gdb:
<img src="images/kavm_2.png# big-p" alt="file missing" />
The symbol table only contains plt entries.
Before digging in GDB, letâ€™s analyze the binary with Ghidra.
<br /></p>

<p>After Ghidra was able to analyze the file, weâ€™re able to find the main function:
<img src="images/kavm_3.png# medium-p" alt="file missing" />
<br /></p>

<p>But upon looking at GDB, we can see that there are is one more address is called: 0x8048440 but we can ignore since what it does is only get the next instruction address and store it at ebx.
<img src="images/kavm_4.png# small" alt="file missing" />
<br /></p>

<p>However, whatâ€™s interesting is the result of ebx when added to 0x2ae6. Letâ€™s run and set breakpoint at address 0x8048520:
<img src="images/kavm_5.png# medium" alt="file missing" />
As we can see from above image, the value of EBX = 0x804b000. Letâ€™s check the byte contents.
<br /></p>

<p>Here is the byte contents from address0x804b000:
<img src="images/kavm_6.png# big" alt="file missing" /></p>
