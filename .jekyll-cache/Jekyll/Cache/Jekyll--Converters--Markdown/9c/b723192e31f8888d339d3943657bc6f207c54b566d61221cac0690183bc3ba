<p><br />
Welcome, fellow hackerman! I am Altelus (a.k.a. FriedTempura). I do various
types of writeups from different CTFs (Capture The Flag) I joined. I mainly do reverse engineering and memory corruption type of writeups but I also do other categories.
<br /> 
Enjoy your stay, hackerman! May the Special Secret Society of Hackermans (SSSoH) live within our hearts forever.</p>
