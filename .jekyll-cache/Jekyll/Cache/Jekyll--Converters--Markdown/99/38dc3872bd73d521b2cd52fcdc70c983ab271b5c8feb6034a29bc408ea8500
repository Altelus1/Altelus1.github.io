Then the challenge gives us this file:

<p>It basically asks for a password then checks if it matches to the password embedded inside the executable, which is also probably the flag.</p>

<p><br />
Let’s run gdb on it and do static analysis. Let’s check for functions and how much symbols is left since the <code class="highlighter-rouge">file</code> command says it is stripped.</p>

<br />
Hmmm… There is no main and only plt entries remained. Let’s find the entry point and the main then.
The entry point is at <code class="highlighter-rouge">0x400770</code>.

Then our main address is 0x400c88.
