<p>Weâ€™re given a file:</p>

<p><img src="images/static_eyeless_1.png# big" alt="file missing" />
<br />
When the file is run, this is the output:
<img src="images/static_eyeless_2.png# medium" alt="file missing" /></p>

<p><br />
Running it with gdb crashes the debugger since its header is corrupted:
<img src="images/static_eyeless_2.png# medium" alt="file missing" /></p>
