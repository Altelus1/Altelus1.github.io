<p><br />
We were given this file:
<br /></p>

<p><img src="images/present_1.png" alt="lol it didn't load" />
<br />
After extracting the contents, we got present.exe.
We can also see what kind of file type it is. A PE binary but packed with UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables)</p>

<p><img src="images/present_2.png" alt="lol it didn't load" />
<br /></p>

<p>We can unpack this using the UPX tool.</p>

<p><img src="images/present_3.png" alt="lol it didn't load" />
<br /></p>

<p>After unpacking, we can now see that it is a windows PE 32 bit. We can do static analysis against the unpacked PE to investigate what it really does.</p>

<p><img src="images/present_4.png" alt="lol it didn't load" /></p>

<p><img src="images/present_5.png" alt="lol it didn't load" />
<br /></p>

<p>To investigate the binary, we used Cutter (radare2 w/ GUI)</p>

<p><img src="images/present_6.png" alt="lol it didn't load" height="100%" width="100%" /></p>

<p>First, we have to find the main. From the image above, it is concluded
that the â€œmainâ€ identified by the Cutter (highlighted)
doesnâ€™t really do thatâ€™s interesting. Therefore, we proceeded finding
other interesting functions</p>

<p><br />
In the image below, we can see there are two mains:</p>

<pre><code class="language-C">sym.__main and sym._main
</code></pre>

<p><img src="images/present_8.png" alt="lol it didn't load" /></p>

<p>Letâ€™s see what</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sym.__main</code></p>

<p>doesâ€¦ It looks like it only goes to the .ctors of the binary</p>

<p><img src="images/present_9.png" alt="lol it didn't load" /></p>

<p>Letâ€™s check <code class="highlighter-rouge">sym._main</code>â€¦ Thereâ€™s an interesting string thatâ€™s encoded in base64</p>

<p><img src="images/present_10.png" alt="lol it didn't load" /></p>

<p><br />
After decoding, we got the flag.</p>

<p><img src="images/present_11.png" alt="lol it didn't load" /></p>

<p>:D :D :D</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
