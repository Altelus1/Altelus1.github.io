<p><br />
We’re given a file:
<img src="images/kavm_1.png# big" alt="file missing" />
<br /></p>

<p>And when we run it, it asks for magic password:
<img src="images/kavm_7.png# medium" alt="file missing" />
<br /></p>

<p>Checking it with gdb:
<img src="images/kavm_2.png# big-p" alt="file missing" />
The symbol table only contains plt entries.
Before digging in GDB, let’s analyze the binary with Ghidra.
<br /></p>

<p>After Ghidra was able to analyze the file, we’re able to find the main function:
<img src="images/kavm_3.png# medium-p" alt="file missing" />
<br /></p>

<p>But upon looking at GDB, we can see that there are is one more address called: 0x8048440 but we can ignore since what it does is only get the next instruction address and store it at ebx.

<br /></p>

<p>However, what’s interesting is the result of ebx when added to 0x2ae6. Let’s run and set breakpoint at address 0x8048520:
<img src="images/kavm_5.png# medium" alt="file missing" />
As we can see from above image, the value of EBX = 0x804b000. Let’s check the byte contents.
<br /></p>

<p>Here is the byte contents from address0x804b000:
<img src="images/kavm_6.png# big" alt="file missing" /></p>

<p>Interesting! Some of the values lying around at different addresses looks like are printable bytes! It looks like for the VM this is where its <em>data segment</em> starts. Let’s check the values:</p>
